## Usage of Daisi

It is recommended to use this application on the daisi platform itself using the link https://app.daisi.io/daisies/vijay/WebVR%20code%20generation/app. However, you can still use your own editor using the below method:

### First, load the Packages:

```
import pydaisi as pyd
webvr_code_generation = pyd.Daisi("vijay/WebVR code generation")
```

### Now, connect to Daisi and access the functions using the following functions:

writeHelp1:

```
webvr_code_generation.writeHelp1().value
```

writeHelp2:

```
webvr_code_generation.writeHelp2().value
```

## And done! Our VR Code Generator is ready!
